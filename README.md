◆ Built basically with HTML, SCSS and JavaScript.

◆ Recently added PostCSS and Autoprefixer for cross-browser compatibility.

◆ I used Parcel bundler initially and had a low score for performance on PageSpeed Insights due to some tree-shaking issues in Parcel.

◆ In terms of style, My goal was to do something simple and minimal. I used flat square-shaped elements throughout the design, avoiding rounded shapes as much as possible.
